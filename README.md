## MedSegDiff - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00611">MedSegDiff</a> in Pytorch - SOTA medical segmentation out of Baidu using DDPM and enhanced conditioning on the feature level, with filtering of features in fourier space.

I will also add attention and introduce an extended type of cross modulation on the attention matrices, alphafold2 style.
